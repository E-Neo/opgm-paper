\subsection{Parallelism of Pipeline Join}\label{sec:experiments_join}
This section tests the speedup of using multiple cores. The speedup is calculated by the time using a single core divided by the time using multiple cores for a specific query.
%The purpose of this experiment is to study the CPU parallelism of SeqStar's pipeline join.
We choose two of the most time-consuming queries $q_6$ and $q_8$ for the study.
%We use speedup to measure the parallelization effect, which is the elapsed time of the single thread join over that of the multi-threaded execution.

Figure~\ref{img:exp_scalability} shows the speedup of SeqStar's pipeline join by varying the number of threads from 1 to 32.
SeqStar has a nearly linear speedup due to the independence of loops in our pipeline join (\S\ref{sec:match_join}).
Noticeably, SeqStar achieved almost optimal speedup within 8 threads.
Specifically, the speedup of BS $q_6$ is 7.6 using 8 threads and the speedup of GO $q_6$ is 6.7.

\subsection{Performance of Predicate Pushdown}
In order to understand the benefits of predicate pushdown,
we ran four of the most time-consuming queries $q_4$, $q_5$, $q_6$ and $q_8$ with the following WHERE clause:
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\small]
  WHERE u1 % 5 = 0 AND u2 % u1 = 5
\end{Verbatim}
The analyzer of SeqStar will analyze the WHERE clause and obtain:
(1) a vertex-constraint `$u_1 \bmod 5 = 0$' and (2) an edge-constraint `$u_2 \bmod u_1 = 5$' (\S\ref{sec:match_optimize}).
These constraints can be applied during the star matching process.

Table~\ref{tab:pushdown_lj} and Table~\ref{tab:pushdown_ok} illustrate the effects of predicate pushdown on LJ and OK\@.
$T$ is the execution time with the optimization, i.e., the constraints have to be checked after the graph isomorphism result is obtained.
$T_{OPT}$ is the execution time with predicate pushdown.
$\#R$ is the result size (number of rows) for the queries without the WHERE clause and $\#R_{OPT}$ is the number of rows with WHERE clause applied.

Because of the vertex-constraint `$u_1 \bmod 5 = 0$',
the \textsc{VertexIter} can skip invalid vertices whenever possible.
When scanning the \textsc{NeighborIter}s,
the edge-constraint `$u_2 \bmod u_1 = 5$' is performed to filter out unnecessary matchings.
The star matching time is reduced by $20\%$ --- $62\%$ in these experiments,
and up to $8 \times 10^5 \times$ of unnecessary results are avoided.
As a result, the total execution time obtains a speedup larger than 525$\times$.
