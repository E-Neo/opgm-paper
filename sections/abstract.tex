Graph matching is one of the most important applications in graph databases.
There are many works have claimed that they can be an order or even orders of magnitude faster
than the existed industrial graph databases.
However, there are still two big gaps that hinder these algorithms from being widely adopted in the real-world scenarios:
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\arabic*)}]
\item the complexity of real-world queries and the simplicity of graphs that the existing algorithms can handle; and
\item the huge memory and high-quality network requirements for the existing algorithms to query on large graphs and the limitation of resource budget.
\end{enumerate*}

To resolve the above problems, we design and implement a practical property graph matching algorithm
that can execute efficiently in an out-of-core enviroment.
The innovation of our algorithm includes
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\arabic*)}]
\item a novel decomposition method of the graph query that can handle both complex graph patterns and property constraints specified by WHERE clauses;
\item an optimized compression representation of the intermediates results and the corresponding join algorithm that do not need to fully decompress it untill the final results;
\item a set of effective data structures for disk-based graph indexes and join process.
\end{enumerate*}
The evaluation results show that \@???.
