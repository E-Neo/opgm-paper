  Property graph matching is the most important operation of graph database and has a wide range of applications.
  The problem has been studied extensively, however, on oversimplified graph models.
  Because of the complexity involving directions, multi-edges, labels in property graphs,
  optimizations aimed at simple graphs are not suitable to handle the storage and matching problem of property graphs.
  Moreover, existing approaches rely on huge memory resources to run their system and hinder the popularity of graph technology.

  We present SeqStar, the first out-of-core property graph matching system that can execute real-world complex queries efficiently.
  The storage engine of SeqStar uses a novel \emph{vertex-centric} storage model.
  By storing necessary information together with the vertices,
  SeqStar avoids the random disk access problem of existing work.
  In the graph matching engine, we propose a novel star decomposition algorithm that preserves all the relevant filtering information on stars.
  Therefore, SeqStar can filter out more unnecessary matchings in the very beginning.
  To reduce the memory usage, SeqStar compresses the intermediate results from star matching and performs pipeline join on the compressed data.
  Moreover, we propose a predicate pushdown method for SeqStar to optimize real-world queries.
