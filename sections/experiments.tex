\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:experiments}
\subsection{Setup}
\subsubsection{Environment}
Most of the experiments were performed on a single machine with two Intel Xeon Processor E5--2699 v4 CPUs, 64 GB of RAM,
and a 800GB SSD\@.
Memory caches were dropped before each experiment to force disk loads.
\subsubsection{Datasets and Queries}
We use real-world data graphs~\cite{snapnets} listed in Table~\ref{tab:datasets}.
The datasets come from difference domains of application, and they range in different size.
The vertices and edges in the datasets are labeled randomly as in~\cite{DBLP:journals/pvldb/MhedhbiS19}.

The queries (Figure~\ref{img:queries}) are selected and edited from existing work~\cite{DBLP:conf/cloud/SerafiniMS17,DBLP:journals/pvldb/MhedhbiS19}.
The labels of vertices and edges are tagged randomly,
and they are represented by the color and the style of lines in Figure~\ref{img:queries}.
The queries we choose represent different topologies: trees, chains, and cyclic graphs.
$q_9$ --- $q_{12}$ are queries with multi-edges.
