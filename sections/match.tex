\section{Property Graph Matching Engine}\label{sec:match}
%% Real world billion-node property graph can easily eat up hundreds of gigabytes,
%% apart from that, even more spaces are required to store the intermediate results,
%% which makes it financially impossible to solve the realistic property graph matching problem totally in memory.
%% However, challenges have to be faced when developing an out-of-core property graph matching engine,
%% because of the infamous random disk access problem.

In this section, we present the property graph match engine of SeqStar.
Based on the vertex-centric storage engine, SeqStar avoids random disk accesses when scanning the graph data file.
The intermediate results explosion problem is resolved by adopting an impressive compression algorithm.
Moreover, we designed an efficient pipeline join method for compressed data,
and developed a series of optimizations for real world property graph matching problems.
