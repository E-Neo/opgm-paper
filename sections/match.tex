\section{Property Graph Matching Engine}\label{sec:match}
%% Real world billion-node property graph can easily eat up hundreds of gigabytes,
%% apart from that, even more spaces are required to store the intermediate results,
%% which makes it financially impossible to solve the realistic property graph matching problem totally in memory.
%% However, challenges have to be faced when developing an out-of-core property graph matching engine,
%% because of the infamous random disk access problem.

%In this section, we present the property graph match engine of SeqStar.
%Based on the vertex-centric storage engine, SeqStar avoids random disk accesses when scanning the graph data file.

SeqStar's graph matching engine is based on the vertex-centric storage to avoid the random disk seeks.
The intermediate results explosion problem is resolved by adopting a compression algorithm which postpones Cartesian product and digs equivalence classes.
Moreover, an efficient pipeline join method can work on compressed data.
