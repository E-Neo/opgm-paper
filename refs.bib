 abstract = {This paper describes the database on U.S. patents that we have developed over the past decade, with the goal of making it widely accessible for research.  We present main trends in U. S. patenting over the last 30 years, including a variety of original measures constructed with citation data, such as backward and forward citation lags, indices of 'originality' and 'generality', self-citations, etc. Many of these measures exhibit interesting differences across the six main technological categories that we have developed (comprising Computers and Communications, Drugs and Medical, Electrical and Electronics, Chemical, Mechanical and Others), differences that call for further research.  To stimulate such research, the entire database about 3 million patents and 16 million citations is now available on the NBER website. We discuss key issues that arise in the use of patent citations data, and suggest ways of addressing them. In particular, significant changes over time in the rate of patenting and in the number of citations made, as well as the inevitable truncation of the data, make it very hard to use the raw number of citations received by different patents directly in a meaningful way. To remedy this problem we suggest two alternative approaches: the fixed-effects approach involves scaling citations by the average citation count for a group of patents to which the patent of interest belongs; the quasi-structural approach attempts to distinguish the multiple effects on citation rates via econometric estimation.},

title = {The Trinity Graph Engine},
year = {2012},
month = {March},
abstract = {Computations performed by graph algorithms are data driven,
and require a high degree of random data access. Despite
the great progresses made in disk technology, it still cannot
provide the level of efficient random access required by graph
computation. On the other hand, memory-based approaches
usually do not scale due to the capacity limit of single machines.
In this paper, we introduce Trinity, a general purpose
graph engine over a distributed memory cloud. Through optimized
memory management and network communication,
Trinity supports fast graph exploration as well as efficient
parallel computing. In particular, Trinity leverages graph
access patterns in both online and offline computation to
optimize memory and communication for best performance.
These enable Trinity to support efficient online query processing
and offline analytics on large graphs with just a few
commodity machines. Furthermore, Trinity provides a high
level specification language called TSL for users to declare
data schema and communication protocols, which brings
great ease-of-use for general purpose graph management and
computing. Our experiments show Trinity’s performance in
both low latency graph queries as well as high throughput
graph analytics on web-scale, billion-node graphs.},
